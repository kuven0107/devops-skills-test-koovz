Q) How would you ensure any change made to this Dockerfile is source controlled, approved, tested and deployed. 
Explain which tools you will use as if this was going into a production environment.
A) Git is used for Version control for all soltware programs update and updates. When Code is checked it, 
it can be set to sent to approvers before it is uploaded and test on QA and then again put into production and approved again before 
taken to production. 
All changed can be tracked and managed with git hub.
